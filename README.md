# MuseCue API

**AI makeup guidance, made for your face.**

The MuseCue API is the NestJS authority for authentication, authorization, workflow state, persistence, and AI orchestration. Supabase is not used. AI providers may interpret or generate data, but only NestJS validates results and advances application state.

The companion mobile application and detailed product specifications live in `../face_makeup_app`.

## Implemented

- PostgreSQL/Prisma local accounts, SMTP verification through BullMQ, login auditing, account lockout, and Google OAuth foundations
- short-lived JWT access tokens and rotating, revocable Redis-backed refresh tokens
- owner-scoped makeup sessions and the documented workflow state machine
- validated multipart image upload, private filesystem storage, image metadata, structured preferences, face analysis, ranked recommendations, saved looks, and selection
- generated guides, authoritative step progression, retained visual attempts, contextual questions, completion history, profile statistics, and optional private profile avatars
- BullMQ jobs for personalization, guide generation, visual checks, and guide questions
- `AiRun` audit records containing operation, provider, model, prompt version, latency, progress, result/error, and status
- a provider-neutral AI gateway with OpenRouter live mode, multimodal private-image input, strict structured output, runtime validation, bounded retries, and deterministic mock mode
- a single Pro subscription plan: admin-configured monthly/yearly pricing and free trial, one-time trial activation, date-based Pro access through `ProAccessGuard`, and payment/lifecycle records protected by database rules (see "Subscriptions" under API); checkout, webhooks and billing endpoints are not implemented yet

Migration `20260827174107_add_makeup_workflow` adds the makeup aggregate and removes the dormant job-tracker and subscription starter domains.

Intentionally deferred:

- a production cloud object-storage adapter and short-lived signed reads; the current private filesystem adapter is intended for local/self-hosted deployments
- generated preview images (recommendation reasoning is live, while the existing curated preview-image contract remains in place)
- production retention/deletion automation and AI cost accounting

## Requirements and setup

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL 17
- Redis 7+
- working SMTP credentials

### Check PostgreSQL and Redis on Ubuntu

Check whether the commands are installed:

```bash
psql --version
redis-server --version
```

Check the Ubuntu PostgreSQL clusters and whether the services are ready:

```bash
pg_lsclusters
pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432
redis-cli ping
```

PostgreSQL should report `accepting connections`, and Redis should return
`PONG`. If the packages are installed but stopped, start them with:

```bash
sudo pg_ctlcluster 17 main start
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

On a system using `systemd`, service status is also available through:

```bash
systemctl status postgresql --no-pager
systemctl status redis-server --no-pager
```

### Install native services on Ubuntu

The repository setup script installs PostgreSQL 17 from the official
PostgreSQL APT repository, installs Redis, starts both services, and verifies
that they respond. It supports Ubuntu/Debian environments with `apt`; run it
from the repository root:

```bash
npm run setup:services
```

You can also invoke it directly:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-services.sh
```

The script may ask for the current user's `sudo` password. It installs and
starts the services, but intentionally does not create application roles or
databases.

### Create development and test databases

Create a local application role and two separate databases. `createuser`
prompts for the new role's password, which avoids putting it in shell history:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt musecue
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=musecue musecue
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=musecue musecue_test
```

If the `musecue` role or either database already exists, do not recreate it.
Use the PostgreSQL administrator account to inspect them instead:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c '\du musecue'
sudo -u postgres psql -c '\l musecue'
sudo -u postgres psql -c '\l musecue_test'
```

For native services, update `.env` to use port `5432` and the password chosen
above. URL-encode the password if it contains reserved URL characters:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://musecue:replace-with-local-password@127.0.0.1:5432/musecue
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://musecue:replace-with-local-password@127.0.0.1:5432/musecue_test
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

The native Redis installation created by the script has no password by
default. Configure Redis authentication before exposing it outside a trusted
local development environment.

Apply migrations only to the development database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

The PostgreSQL-backed E2E tests create and drop temporary schemas inside
`musecue_test`; they do not use or reset the development database. Export the
test URL before running Jest because the E2E helper reads
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` from the process environment:

```bash
export TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://musecue:replace-with-local-password@127.0.0.1:5432/musecue_test'
npm run test:e2e -- --runInBand
```

The `musecue` role owns `musecue_test`, so it has the `CREATE` permission the
tests need for their temporary schemas.

### Docker setup

The example environment uses Docker PostgreSQL on host port `5433`, unlike
the native Ubuntu service on port `5432`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres_db redis-stack
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run start:dev
```

The API defaults to `http://localhost:5000`; development Swagger is at `http://localhost:5000/docs`.

Important environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. Never commit the real `.env` or log SMTP credentials, tokens, image contents, or future signed URLs.

`PRIVATE_UPLOAD_DIR` controls the private image root and defaults to `.data/private-images`. The directory is ignored by Git and is never mounted as a public static directory.

### Live AI with OpenRouter

The backend defaults to live AI outside the test environment. Create a fresh OpenRouter key and add it only to the ignored `.env` file:

```dotenv
AI_MODE=live
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-new-key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openrouter/free
```

Restart the API and BullMQ worker after changing environment variables. Use `AI_MODE=mock` for deterministic offline development. The optional analysis, guide, vision, and question model variables allow each operation to be routed independently without changing services or mobile API contracts.

Initial analysis and makeup checks read owned images from private storage and send them to OpenRouter as in-request data URLs. They are never exposed through permanent public URLs. Structured responses are validated again by Zod before any transaction changes workflow state. Provider timeouts, rate limits, and server failures use the existing BullMQ job retry budget; invalid credentials and other non-retryable requests fail immediately.

`openrouter/free` is useful for development, but model choice and availability can vary. For face-photo privacy, review the chosen model/provider policy and optionally set `OPENROUTER_DATA_COLLECTION=deny`; that restriction may leave fewer or no free providers. Production should pin evaluated vision/text models rather than rely on the free router.

### Bite-sized guide instructions

Spoken guides need a larger output budget than the former text-only guide. The example configuration uses `OPENROUTER_GUIDE_MAX_TOKENS=8000` and `OPENROUTER_GUIDE_TIMEOUT_MS=90000`. Update existing deployments too; changing `.env.example` does not override their environment. Token precedence remains operation-specific setting, then `OPENROUTER_MAX_TOKENS`, then the built-in operation default (8,000 for guides). Other operations keep their existing budgets. The increased cap can increase cost and latency; it is not a guarantee of provider capacity.

For a pinned model/provider that supports reasoning effort, optionally set `OPENROUTER_GUIDE_REASONING_EFFORT=low`. Leave it unset for models/routers with unverified support. Supported values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; the model must support the chosen value. Reasoning still consumes output tokens even when its text is excluded. See [OpenRouter reasoning controls](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens).

Provider failures are classified before checking for empty text: token exhaustion becomes `AI_OUTPUT_TRUNCATED`, content filtering becomes `AI_CONTENT_FILTERED`, and embedded provider errors (including HTTP 200 error envelopes) use the same retry policy as HTTP failures. Token exhaustion and filtering terminate immediately instead of repeating identical requests; transient failures still use the bounded queue retry policy. No partial guide is saved. After correcting configuration, restart API/workers and use the app's retry action; old failed jobs are not automatically re-run.

Worker retry/failure logs include the run ID, operation, error code, and allowlisted diagnostics (HTTP/provider status, normalized finish reason, completion/reasoning token counts, content character count, configured token limit and timeout). They never include raw provider errors, response text, reasoning, prompts, images, URLs, or credentials. Search logs for the run ID to distinguish a token cutoff, empty response, timeout, or provider failure. Public API contracts and workflow transitions are unchanged.

Conversational coaching uses `GUIDE_V4_PAIRED_COACHING` and `MAKEUP_CHECK_V2_SPOKEN_COACHING`. Guide output now includes `spokenIntro` (up to 140 characters) and `spokenSubsteps` (one per written substep, up to 220 characters each). The gateway enforces equal array lengths and validates nonempty bounded strings. Check output includes `spokenFeedback` (up to 400 characters) alongside the unchanged result, confidence, and written feedback. The prompts require the same actions and evaluation in both versions, evidence-based encouragement, one correction at a time, and explicit uncertainty when visibility is insufficient. Semantic consistency still requires model evaluation; schema validation cannot prove advice quality.

Guide V4 adds three paired checklist/voice examples to distinguish concise written instructions from conversational coaching. Examples demonstrate style only, not products or actions to insert into unrelated guides. The prompt discourages whole-array copying and mechanical filler while allowing an already-natural short sentence to remain unchanged. Validation, retry behavior, API contracts, and playback are unchanged. Restart API/workers and generate a new guide to test this prompt; existing stored guides are not rewritten. Prompt examples improve guidance but do not guarantee distinct model wording.

Migration `20260906210000_add_spoken_coaching` adds nullable intro/feedback fields and an empty-default spoken-substep array, preserving existing records. Spoken text is stored with the guide and attempt, and returned in the existing session/job responses. Older mobile clients can ignore these additive fields; new clients fall back to written text for old sessions. No additional AI requests, queues, or workflow transitions are introduced. Deploy migrations and restart API/workers before generating new guides.

Guide prompt `GUIDE_V4_PAIRED_COACHING` asks the existing OpenRouter model for 2–6 ordered `substeps` per main step. Each item is one concrete action, at most 180 characters. The shared prompt is used by the live gateway, and Zod validates this field before the worker persists it. The deterministic mock gateway follows the same contract.

Migration `20260906190000_add_guide_substeps` adds `GuideStep.substeps` as a non-null text array with an empty default, preserving existing guides. Deploy migrations and regenerate Prisma before restarting the API/workers. The session API returns the additive field; `instruction` remains available for older clients and history. No new job or endpoint is needed. The app controls local instruction-by-instruction playback, while NestJS retains ownership of main-step progression and checks.

### Traffic and provider capacity

The makeup worker processes I/O-bound AI jobs concurrently, while Redis-backed global concurrency and rate limits cap aggregate OpenRouter traffic across every running API instance. Interactive vision checks and coach questions receive higher queue priority than initial analysis and guide generation. A short provider `429` pauses the shared queue only for its requested delay and may defer a job twice. Multi-hour quota exhaustion fails immediately so jobs reach a terminal state instead of freezing the queue. Other transient failures use the three-attempt exponential backoff budget with jitter.

Defaults are conservative for development:

```dotenv
AI_QUEUE_GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY=4
AI_QUEUE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=15
AI_QUEUE_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION_MS=60000
AI_QUEUE_MAX_BACKLOG=1000
AI_QUEUE_MAX_PROVIDER_PAUSE_MS=120000
AI_QUEUE_MAX_RATE_LIMIT_DEFERRALS=2
```

Increase these only after pinning production models and matching the limits on your OpenRouter account. Multiple backend instances can consume the same queue; the Redis limits remain global. New jobs receive a service-unavailable response once the configurable backlog ceiling is reached instead of growing an unbounded queue. `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS` can provide comma-separated capacity fallbacks, and `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_SORT=throughput` can favor faster providers. Large stored images are resized and JPEG-compressed in memory before provider delivery, while already-small mobile images pass through unchanged.

The free router is intended for development and cannot provide bulk-production capacity. Paid models, explicit account spending caps, production observability, and load testing are required before a public launch.

### Workflow and authentication reliability

- Session writes and AI result publication share a PostgreSQL row lock. Repeated completion requests do not reopen an earlier step. AI-run idempotency keys are scoped to their owner, session, operation, and step.
- Every 30 seconds, recovery checks pending runs older than `AI_JOB_RECOVERY_GRACE_MS` (default/minimum 120000 ms), in batches of 100. Missing or terminal BullMQ jobs become terminal `FAILED` runs so clients stop polling and can retry. Healthy waiting, prioritized, delayed, or active jobs are left alone. A Redis outage postpones recovery; it is not evidence that jobs are missing.
- Terminal runs and superseded worker attempts cannot publish late AI results. Recovery uses existing PostgreSQL/BullMQ state, not another queue. Restart the API/workers to activate it; no migration is required.
- Refresh-token rotation compares and replaces the token hash and updates the Redis session index in one Lua operation. Temporary Redis failures return 503 instead of invalidating authentication. These scripts use the existing single Redis instance, not Redis Cluster.
- Rate-limit exemptions match documentation/metrics paths only. Query-string text cannot disable throttling.
- `POST /v1/recommendations/:recommendationId/saved` accepts `{ "saved": true }` or `{ "saved": false }` for retry-safe state changes. A body without `saved` retains the legacy toggle behavior.

| `GET`    | `/v1/profile`                                                      | Return the current user's profile                  |

Queueing mutations accept an `Idempotency-Key`. Every owned record is scoped with the JWT user ID; clients cannot supply another user's owner ID.

The image endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` fields `image` and `purpose=INITIAL_ANALYSIS`. JPEG, PNG, and WebP files must be 10 MB or smaller and between 320 and 8192 pixels on each axis. The API derives this metadata from the actual bytes.

The avatar upload accepts a single `image` field. The mobile client crops and compresses it before upload; the API independently validates JPEG, PNG, or WebP content up to 5 MB and stores it under the authenticated user's private profile scope.

Private image reads require the same bearer token and verify ownership through the image's session. Completed-session deletion cascades through its guide, steps, attempts, questions, recommendations, and image metadata, then removes its private files. Active workflows cannot be deleted through the history endpoint.

Successful responses use one envelope:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Subscriptions

Administration routes require a bearer token for an `ADMIN` or `SUPERADMIN` account; other roles, including `MODERATOR`, receive `403`. The role is read from the verified access token (no extra database lookup), so a role change applies once the user's access token is replaced or revoked through `tokenVersion`. Role names are the Prisma `userRole` values (`USER`, `MODERATOR`, `ADMIN`, `SUPERADMIN`); the TypeScript `UserRole` is derived from that enum.

| Method  | Route                         | Purpose                                |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET`   | `/v1/admin/subscription-plan` | Read the Pro plan configuration        |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/admin/subscription-plan` | Change any subset of the configuration |

MuseCue has a single Pro plan stored in the `SubscriptionPlan` table, so its settings survive restarts. Before an administrator saves anything, the API serves these defaults:

| Field                  | Type    | Default         | Accepted values                             |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `planEnabled`          | boolean | `true`          | `true` / `false`                            |
| `monthlyPriceUsdCents` | integer | `1900` ($19)    | `1`–`999999` US cents                       |
| `yearlyPriceUsdCents`  | integer | `19000` ($190)  | `1`–`999999` US cents                       |
| `trialEnabled`         | boolean | `true`          | `true` / `false`                            |
| `trialDays`            | integer | `7`             | `1`–`365`; kept while the trial is disabled |

`PATCH` accepts any subset of these fields; omitted fields are unchanged. Empty bodies, `null`, fractional numbers, numeric or boolean strings, and unknown fields are rejected with `400`. The trial is switched off with `trialEnabled: false`, not with a zero length. Every change is recorded in `ActivityLogEvent` (old value, new value, administrator ID) in the same transaction as the plan update.

```json
{
  "code": "PRO",
  "currency": "USD",
  "planEnabled": true,
  "monthlyPriceUsdCents": 1900,
  "yearlyPriceUsdCents": 19000,
  "trialEnabled": true,
  "trialDays": 7,
  "updatedAt": null
}
```

Migration `20260912120000_plan_billing_intervals_and_toggles` upgrades configurations saved by `20260910120000_add_subscription_plan_config`: the former single `priceUsdCents` becomes the monthly price (or `1900` if it was never set), the yearly price starts at `19000`, and a former `trialDays: 0` becomes `trialEnabled: false` with `trialDays: 7`. Earlier audit entries keep the old `priceUsdCents` field name.

Each user has at most one `UserSubscription` record (migration `20260914120000_add_user_subscription`). A user without a record is `FREE`. The record tracks the one-time free trial (`trialUsed`, `trialStartedAt`, `trialExpiresAt`) separately from the renewable paid term (`billingInterval`, `proStartedAt`, `proExpiresAt`, `proCanceledAt`). Pro access is decided only in `src/subscription/subscription-access.policy.ts`, exposed through `SubscriptionAccessService`. Access is granted while the trial or the paid term is within its `[startedAt, expiresAt)` window, including a canceled term until it expires. The stored `status` (`FREE`, `TRIAL`, `PRO`, `EXPIRED`) is a snapshot and is not used on its own to grant access. A trial can be started only once, only while the plan and its trial are enabled, and never by a user with any paid Pro history (active, canceled or expired). Pro fields are never cleared, so `proStartedAt` serves as that history. CHECK constraints keep the record's fields and status consistent.

Subscription history is permanent at the database level (migration `20260916120000_protect_subscription_history`, a trigger that Prisma does not model). Once a trial has started, its dates never change and `trialUsed` stays `true`. A paid term can be renewed or replaced but never cleared, and the record cannot be deleted while its user exists; deleting the user still cascades. As a result, no code path can re-open trial eligibility or extend a trial.

Billing records for the future payment integration (migration `20260918120000_add_payments_and_subscription_events`; no checkout, webhooks or billing endpoints yet):

- `PaymentTransaction` records one charge attempt for one billing period. It stores the amount in cents, currency, status (`PENDING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`, `REFUNDED`), `provider` + `providerPaymentId`, the period, timestamps, and failure and refund details.
  - `(provider, providerPaymentId)` is unique, and only one verified payment may cover a given period.
  - Payments are never deleted. Amount, currency, provider IDs and period never change, and status only moves forward.
  - A user with payments cannot be hard-deleted.
- `SubscriptionEvent` is an append-only lifecycle log: `TRIAL_STARTED`, `CREATED`, `RENEWED`, `CANCELED`, `EXPIRED`. `CREATED` and `RENEWED` reference the `SUCCEEDED` payment for the period, and each payment backs at most one event.
- `UserSubscription` gains `paymentProvider` and `providerSubscriptionId` (unique together) to link the provider's recurring subscription.
- A paid term (`proStartedAt`/`proExpiresAt`) can only be created or extended by a `SUCCEEDED` payment of the same subscription and interval that covers the newly granted range and ends exactly at `proExpiresAt`. A new term may not start before its paid period, and a renewal's period must start no later than the current expiry, so it cannot bridge an unpaid gap. Early renewals and monthly-to-yearly changes may overlap. Pending, failed and refunded payments never grant or renew Pro access. Cancelling keeps access until `proExpiresAt`.
- A billing period ends exactly one calendar month or year after it starts, using PostgreSQL calendar arithmetic (migration `20260920120000_calendar_billing_periods_and_gap_free_terms`). Month-ends clamp: Jan 31 → Feb 28, or Feb 29 in a leap year. Feb 29 + 1 year → Feb 28. `src/subscription/billing.validation.ts` (`addBillingInterval`, `isValidBillingPeriod`, `getPaidTermRejection`, pricing and status-transition checks) applies the same rules for future checkout and webhook code.

`GET /v1/subscription` (bearer token) returns the caller's own subscription. The user comes only from the access token; query parameters cannot select another user. `status` is evaluated at request time from the stored dates, not the stored `status` column. Expiry therefore needs no background job, and reads never rewrite the record or its trial history.

| `status`  | When                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FREE`    | No trial and no paid term (including users without a record)      |
| `TRIAL`   | `trialStartedAt <= now < trialExpiresAt`                            |
| `PRO`     | `proStartedAt <= now < proExpiresAt` (also wins during a trial)     |
| `EXPIRED` | A trial or paid term existed and none is running (from the exact expiry instant) |

The response also contains `hasProAccess`, `accessSource`, `accessExpiresAt`, and two objects:

- `trial`: `eligible`, `ineligibleReason` (`ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`, `PLAN_DISABLED`, `TRIAL_DISABLED`, `TRIAL_ALREADY_USED`, `HAS_PRO_HISTORY`), `used`, `active`, `startedAt`, `expiresAt`.
- `pro`: `active`, `billingInterval`, `startedAt`, `expiresAt`, `canceledAt`.

`POST /v1/subscription/trial` (bearer token, no body) starts the caller's free trial. It stores `trialStartedAt` = now and `trialExpiresAt` = now + the plan's `trialDays`, and returns `201` with the access summary and trial dates. Rejections:

| Status | Message                                                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `403`  | `Only active accounts can start a free trial` (status `ACTIVE`, verified email, not soft-deleted) |
| `403`  | `The free trial is not currently available` (plan or trial disabled)             |
| `409`  | `The free trial has already been used`                                           |
| `409`  | `The free trial is only available to accounts that have never subscribed to Pro` |

Activation runs in one transaction: the account check, plan settings, trial write and audit event all succeed or fail together, so a failed activation never uses up the trial. Repeated or concurrent requests cannot create a second trial or change an existing trial's dates.

Pro feature endpoints are protected by `ProAccessGuard`, applied after `AuthGuard` in any module that imports `SubscriptionModule`:

```ts
@UseGuards(AuthGuard, ProAccessGuard)
@Get('some-pro-feature')
handler(@Req() req: ProAccessRequest) { /* req.proAccess: status, accessSource, accessExpiresAt */ }
```

The guard delegates to `SubscriptionAccessService`, the single Pro access decision. An active free trial and an active paid term unlock the same features, each within its own `[startedAt, expiresAt)` window. Without access, the guard returns `403` with `An active Pro subscription or free trial is required` and the handler does not run. Requests that did not pass `AuthGuard` are rejected with `401`, and lookup errors never grant access. No makeup endpoint uses the guard yet.

Database tests (`test/subscription-plan.*.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/user-subscription.*.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/subscription-trial.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/subscription-status.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/pro-access.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/trial-lifecycle.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/billing.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/subscription-security.e2e-spec.ts`) run only when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set, and are reported as skipped otherwise. Each test builds a temporary schema from the migration files and drops it afterwards, so the database user needs `CREATE` permission:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/musecue_test npx jest --config ./test/jest-e2e.json test/subscription-plan test/user-subscription test/subscription-trial test/subscription-status test/pro-access test/trial-lifecycle test/billing test/subscription-security
```

Mock and live gateways implement the same application-owned operations. The live gateway delegates transport to an OpenRouter provider adapter, workers validate and normalize model-shaped output, and NestJS alone persists it transactionally and advances workflow state. No frontend or public API contract changes are required to switch modes or add another provider adapter.
